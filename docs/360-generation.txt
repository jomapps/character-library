MODEL NOTES (Nano Banana or similar)
Always include the master reference image with consistent reference_weight (0.85 0.95).
For angle swaps, keep background + lighting identical; only change ANGLE/CROP/LENS.
Lock the seed for a pack run; change seed only for a new version (v2, v3 ).
Pose guidance strength: ~0.35 0.55 for natural variation, identity intact.
