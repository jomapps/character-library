# Character Library Deployment Status & Action Plan

## Current Situation

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- **Novel Movie Application**: Successfully deployed and running at `https://character.ft.tc` on port 3001
- **Character Library Codebase**: Complete implementation with all required endpoints
- **Integration Code**: CharacterLibraryClient and integration utilities implemented
- **Configuration**: Environment variables and configuration files set up correctly
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation and usage examples

### ‚ùå What's Missing
- **Character Library Service Deployment**: The actual Character Library service is not deployed
- **URL Conflict**: Novel Movie is currently deployed at `https://character.ft.tc` instead of Character Library

## The Problem

According to the pending issues in `docs/novel-required-improvements.md`:

> **Deploy the Character Library Service**: You need to deploy the actual Character Library service (which should be a separate Payload CMS application with character management capabilities) to either:
> - `https://character.ft.tc` (replacing the current Novel Movie instance)
> - Or a different URL like `https://character-library.ft.tc`

**Current Status**: 
- `https://character.ft.tc` ‚Üí Novel Movie Application (INCORRECT)
- Character Library Service ‚Üí NOT DEPLOYED

**Should Be**:
- `https://character.ft.tc` ‚Üí Character Library Service
- Novel Movie ‚Üí Different URL (e.g., `https://novel-movie.ft.tc`)

## Required Actions

### 1. Deploy Character Library Service

The Character Library service should be deployed as a **separate application** with these characteristics:

#### Service Requirements
- **Framework**: Payload CMS v3 with Next.js (same as current codebase)
- **Purpose**: Character management, image generation, and Novel Movie integration
- **Database**: Separate MongoDB instance for character data
- **Collections**: Characters, Media, Users (character-focused)

#### Required Endpoints
```
GET  /api/health                                    - Health check
POST /api/v1/characters/novel-movie                 - Create Novel Movie character
PUT  /api/v1/characters/{id}/novel-movie-sync       - Sync character updates
POST /api/v1/characters/{id}/generate-scene-image   - Generate scene images
POST /api/v1/characters/{id}/generate-initial-image - Generate master reference
POST /api/v1/characters/{id}/generate-core-set      - Generate 360¬∞ reference set
POST /api/v1/characters/query                       - Natural language queries
POST /api/v1/characters/validate-project-consistency - Validate consistency
POST /api/v1/characters/batch-validate              - Batch validation
GET  /api/v1/characters/{id}/quality-metrics        - Quality metrics
POST /api/v1/characters/{id}/relationships          - Manage relationships
GET  /api/v1/characters/relationships/graph         - Relationship graph
```

### 2. Deployment Options

#### Option A: Replace Current Deployment (Recommended)
1. **Backup Novel Movie**: Export current Novel Movie data
2. **Deploy Character Library**: Deploy Character Library service to `https://character.ft.tc`
3. **Redeploy Novel Movie**: Deploy Novel Movie to `https://novel-movie.ft.tc`
4. **Update Configurations**: Update all URL references

#### Option B: Deploy to Alternative URL
1. **Deploy Character Library**: Deploy to `https://character-library.ft.tc`
2. **Update Configuration**: Change `CHARACTER_LIBRARY_API_URL` to new URL
3. **Keep Novel Movie**: Leave Novel Movie at current URL

### 3. Configuration Updates Needed

#### If Using Option A (character.ft.tc for Character Library)
```bash
# Novel Movie Environment Variables
CHARACTER_LIBRARY_API_URL=https://character.ft.tc

# Novel Movie new deployment URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL=https://novel-movie.ft.tc
```

#### If Using Option B (character-library.ft.tc)
```bash
# Novel Movie Environment Variables  
CHARACTER_LIBRARY_API_URL=https://character-library.ft.tc

# Keep current Novel Movie URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL=https://character.ft.tc
```

### 4. Character Library Service Codebase

The Character Library should be based on the **current codebase** but with:

#### Included Components
- ‚úÖ All Character-related collections and APIs
- ‚úÖ Image generation services (DINO, FAL.ai integration)
- ‚úÖ PathRAG integration for character queries
- ‚úÖ Quality assurance and validation systems
- ‚úÖ Novel Movie integration endpoints

#### Excluded Components
- ‚ùå Novel Movie specific collections (Projects, Stories, etc.)
- ‚ùå Novel Movie workflow APIs
- ‚ùå Novel Movie frontend components
- ‚ùå BAML integration (Novel Movie specific)

#### Database Schema
```typescript
// Character Library Collections
- characters     // Main character data with Novel Movie integration
- media         // Character images and assets
- users         // Character Library users

// Novel Movie Integration Fields in Characters
- novelMovieIntegration: {
    projectId: string
    projectName: string
    lastSyncAt: Date
    syncStatus: 'synced' | 'pending' | 'conflict' | 'error'
  }
```

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Character Library Codebase
1. **Clone Current Codebase**: Use current implementation as base
2. **Remove Novel Movie Components**: Remove project/story specific code
3. **Focus on Character Features**: Keep only character-related functionality
4. **Update Configuration**: Set up for Character Library deployment

### Step 2: Deploy Character Library Service
1. **Set up Infrastructure**: Server, domain, SSL certificates
2. **Deploy Application**: Deploy Character Library to chosen URL
3. **Configure Database**: Set up MongoDB for character data
4. **Test Endpoints**: Verify all required endpoints work

### Step 3: Update Novel Movie Integration
1. **Update Environment Variables**: Point to Character Library service
2. **Test Integration**: Verify Novel Movie can connect to Character Library
3. **Update Documentation**: Update all URL references

### Step 4: Migrate Data (if needed)
1. **Export Character Data**: From current Novel Movie deployment
2. **Import to Character Library**: Migrate existing characters
3. **Verify Data Integrity**: Ensure all data migrated correctly

## Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Ready Components
- **CharacterLibraryClient**: Complete implementation with retry logic
- **Integration Utilities**: High-level integration functions
- **Configuration**: Environment variables and config files
- **API Endpoints**: All required endpoints implemented
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when service unavailable

### üìã Next Steps
1. **Decision**: Choose deployment option (A or B)
2. **Infrastructure**: Set up server for Character Library
3. **Deployment**: Deploy Character Library service
4. **Testing**: Verify integration works end-to-end
5. **Documentation**: Update all references to correct URLs

## Testing the Integration

Once Character Library is deployed, test with:

```bash
# Health check
curl https://character.ft.tc/api/health

# Create character
curl -X POST https://character.ft.tc/api/v1/characters/novel-movie \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "novelMovieProjectId": "test-project",
    "characterData": {
      "name": "Test Character",
      "age": 25,
      "description": "A test character"
    }
  }'

# Query characters
curl -X POST https://character.ft.tc/api/v1/characters/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query": "Tell me about test characters"
  }'
```

## Summary

The Character Library integration code is **complete and ready**. The only missing piece is the **actual deployment** of the Character Library service as a separate application. Once deployed, the Novel Movie application will be able to:

1. ‚úÖ Create characters in Character Library
2. ‚úÖ Generate character images with consistency validation  
3. ‚úÖ Query character information using natural language
4. ‚úÖ Validate character consistency across projects
5. ‚úÖ Handle service unavailability gracefully

**Recommendation**: Deploy Character Library to `https://character.ft.tc` and move Novel Movie to `https://novel-movie.ft.tc` for clear service separation.
