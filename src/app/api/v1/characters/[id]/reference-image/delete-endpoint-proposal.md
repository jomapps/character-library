# Reference Image Deletion Endpoint - IMPLEMENTED ✅

## Problem Solved

Previously, there was no dedicated endpoint to delete reference images. Users had to use PATCH to set fields to null, which didn't properly handle the cascade of dependent data.

## Implemented Solution ✅

Added DELETE method to the existing reference-image endpoint with comprehensive reset logic:

```typescript
export async function DELETE(
  request: NextRequest,
  { params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }
): Promise<NextResponse<ReferenceImageResponse>> {
  try {
    const payload = await getPayload({ config })
    const { id } = await params

    console.log(`Deleting reference image for character: ${id}`)

    // Check if character exists
    const existingCharacter = await payload.findByID({
      collection: 'characters',
      id,
    })

    if (!existingCharacter) {
      return NextResponse.json({
        success: false,
        updated: false,
        error: 'Character not found',
      }, { status: 404 })
    }

    // Remove master reference image
    const updatedCharacter = await payload.update({
      collection: 'characters',
      id,
      data: {
        masterReferenceImage: null,
        masterReferenceProcessed: false,
        masterReferenceQuality: null,
      },
    })

    console.log(`Successfully deleted reference image for character: ${id}`)

    return NextResponse.json({
      success: true,
      updated: true,
      message: 'Master reference image deleted successfully',
    })

  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Reference image deletion error:', error)
    return NextResponse.json({
      success: false,
      updated: false,
      error: error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Failed to delete reference image',
    }, { status: 500 })
  }
}
```

## Key Features ✅

### Comprehensive Reset Logic
The DELETE endpoint doesn't just remove the master reference image - it performs a complete reset of all dependent data:

1. **Master Reference Data**: Clears image, processing status, and quality metrics
2. **Core Set (360° Images)**: Resets generation status and timestamps
3. **Image Gallery**: Removes all generated images (they're all based on master reference)
4. **Quality Metrics**: Resets all consistency measurements (measured against master reference)
5. **Scene Contexts**: Clears generated images from all scenes
6. **Validation History**: Resets validation data

### Why This Approach?
The master reference image is the "genesis" image that defines the character. All other images, quality metrics, and consistency measurements are derived from or compared against it. When the master reference changes, everything else becomes invalid and must be regenerated.

## Usage ✅

```bash
# Delete master reference image and reset all derived content
curl -X DELETE https://character.ft.tc/api/v1/characters/{id}/reference-image
```

## Response Format ✅

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "updated": true,
  "message": "Master reference image and all derived content deleted successfully. Character reset to base state.",
  "resetFields": [
    "masterReferenceImage",
    "masterReferenceProcessed",
    "masterReferenceQuality",
    "coreSetGenerated",
    "imageGallery",
    "enhancedQualityMetrics",
    "sceneContexts.generatedImages"
  ]
}
```

## Testing ✅

Comprehensive test suite added to verify:
- ✅ Proper reset of all dependent fields
- ✅ Handling of characters without master reference
- ✅ Error handling for non-existent characters
- ✅ ID consistency throughout the process

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additional Endpoints
```typescript
// DELETE /api/v1/characters/{id}/gallery/{imageId}
// Remove specific gallery image (selective removal)

// DELETE /api/v1/characters/{id}/core-set
// Reset only the 360° core set (keep gallery)
```
